Create page that has a single button on it. When I click the button, the following should happen:

- content should be loaded via AJAX an API of your choice.
- some (or all, up to you) of the content loaded from the API should be rendered onto the page with JavaScript.
- your page should be styled with CSS
- you should use at least one CSS transition or animation on your page.
